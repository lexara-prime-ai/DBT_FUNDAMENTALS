What is an **ETL process**?
ETL refers to the process of **Extracting Manipulating/Transforming & Loading** data.

## Data Warehouses
Data Warehouses combine a database and a supercomputer for transforming data.
Data can now be transformed directly in the database. There's no need to extract and load repeatedly.

This resulted in **ELT** processes i.e **Extract Load Transform**.
This means that the Data Team can focus on first **extracting** some data from a **source** and then **loading** it into their warehouse. The data can then be **transformed**.
